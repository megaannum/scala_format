==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                                *format-intro*

Format arguments for both function definitions and function calls.

Basically, I got tired to formating arguments (so to speak) by hand, so I
wrote this.  When you have method definitions or calls where the argument list
is longer than you want (longer than your page width), then this script can
reformat the arguments so that the are all aligned with the first argument
each on its own line.  Also, when an argument is a bunch of strings
concatenated with plus operator, '+', this script will also place each piece
of a string on its own line.

==============================================================================
2. Instalation                                                 *format-install*

The {Format} autoload 'format.vim' code file should be in the 'autoload/scala'
directory, the 'format.txt' in the 'doc/scala' directory and the plugin
'format.vim' code in the 'plugin/scala' directory.

==============================================================================
3. Options                                                     *format-options*

These help control the behavior of format.vim.
Remember, if you change these in the code itself and then upgrade to a later
version, your changes will be lost.

Value of the additional indent given to the additional members of a 
string argument.
If an argument is a string concatenated from multiple parts, this
option defined the additional indend for the later parts of the string.
Recommend setting to 0 or 2. >
  let g:scala_format_extra_string_arg_offset = 2
<
Value of the additional indent given to the additional arguments
after the first argument.
All arguments after the first are indented an additional number
of spaces.
Recommend setting to 0 
(It was easy to add this feature but I would not use it.) >
  let g:scala_format_extra_arg_offset = 0
<
Value of the maximum number of args that can be formatted. 
This also limits how many lines are search for the terminating ')'. >
  let s:scala_format_max_number_args = 15
<
Value of the maximum number of lines to search after the start of
the method for a non-white space character. >
  let g:scala_format_max_line_search_after_method_start = 2
<

4. Supported Platforms                                       *format-platforms*

The {Format} script ought to run all all platforms.

==============================================================================
5. Usage                                                        *format-usage*

Place the cursor on any character in the method name or on the methods left
paren, '(', and then invoke this script. If you use the binding above, you
would enter <Leader>f.

The script finds the first non-white-space character after the method's left
paren and uses that as the character position for aligning all arguments. 

Examples of method calls: >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, thisIsArgTwo, thisIsArgThree(), thisIsArgFour): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
becomes >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, 
     thisIsArgTwo, 
     thisIsArgThree(), 
     thisIsArgFour): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

and the following (note first argument position): >
  aVeryLongMethodNameAsAnExampleUsage(
                          thisIsArgOne, thisIsArgTwo, thisIsArgThree, thisIsArgFour): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
becomes >
  aVeryLongMethodNameAsAnExampleUsage(
                          thisIsArgOne, 
                          thisIsArgTwo, 
                          thisIsArgThree, 
                          thisIsArgFour): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

becomes (with g:scala_format_extra_arg_offset = 2) >
  aVeryLongMethodNameAsAnExampleUsage(
                          thisIsArgOne, 
                            thisIsArgTwo, 
                            thisIsArgThree, 
                            thisIsArgFour): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

Generally, in this case you can change the location of the first method
argument and reformat and it works (the rest of the arguments are aligned
under the first argument).

Examples of method calls with string arguments: >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, "this is" + somestring + "a \"foo()\" test", thisIsArgThree): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
becomes (with let g:scala_format_extra_string_arg_offset = 0) >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, 
     "this is" + 
     somestring + 
     "a \"foo()\" test", 
     thisIsArgThree): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
or becomes (with let g:scala_format_extra_string_arg_offset = 2) >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, 
     "this is" + 
       somestring + 
       "a \"foo()\" test", 
     thisIsArgThree): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

Yea, it can actually do this. 

One more example of a method where an argument is itself a method call: >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, thisIsArgTwo(innerOne, innerTwo), thisIsArgThree()): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
placing cursor on "m1(" and invoking this script becomes >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, 
     thisIsArgTwo(innerOne, innerTwo), 
     thisIsArgThree()): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
then placing cursor on "thisIsArgTwo(" and invoking this script becomes >
  m1(thisIsArgOne, 
     thisIsArgTwo(innerOne, 
                  innerTwo), 
     thisIsArgThree()): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

Examples of method definitions: >
  def m1(thisIsArgOne: String, thisIsArgTwo: Int, thisIsArgThree: Float): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
becomes >
  def m1(thisIsArgOne: String, 
         thisIsArgTwo: Int, 
         thisIsArgThree: Float): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

and the following (note first argument position): >
  def aVeryLongMethodNameAsAnExampleUsage(
                          thisIsArgOne: String, thisIsArgTwo: Int, thisIsArgThree: Float): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<
becomes >
  def aVeryLongMethodNameAsAnExampleUsage(
                          thisIsArgOne: String, 
                          thisIsArgTwo: Int, 
                          thisIsArgThree: Float): Sometype = {
    ....
  }
<

Array definition:
As an unplanned extra, this can be used to format the arguments to an
array: >
  val a = Array[Int] ( 1, 3, 4, 5, 4)
<
becomes >
  val a = Array[Int] ( 1, 
                       3, 
                       4, 
                       5, 
                       4)
<
and >
  val a = Array[Int] ( 
            1, 3, 4, 5, 4)
<
becomes >
  val a = Array[Int] ( 
            1, 
            3, 
            4, 
            5, 
            4)
<
Ok, so formating an array does not do too much.

6. FAQ                                                             *format-faq*

    Q: Why don't you support my favorite way of formating method arguments?
<
    A: Tell me about it an maybe I will.

7. Release notes                                        *format-release-notes*

    2.0 Release Note: ~
      Support for autoloading.

    1.1 Release Note: ~
      Maximum number of arguments is now a parameter with default
      value 10 (the original value). This can now be modified to
      allow for the formating of more than 10 arguments.
      Maximum number of lines to search for the first non-white space
      character is now a parameter with default value 2 (the original
      value). One is not likely to ever need to increase this value.

    1.0 Release Note: ~
      Initial public release.

==============================================================================
8. Caveats                                                     *format-caveats*

Works most of the time, but sometimes when the arguments span multiple lines
one must first get them all back on the same line again before invoking this
code .... but not always.

If you have a method call with arguments which are themselves method calls,
the arguments to the inner-method are not formated within the inner-call.

==============================================================================
9. Todo List                                                    *format-todo*
    * Empty for now.
